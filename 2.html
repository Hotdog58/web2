<h3>Fly like a Bird</h3>
<p>The peak speed of the butterfly is faster than that of the front crawl, or freestyle due to the synchronous pull/push with both arms and legs, which is done quite fast.</P> <p> Yet since speed drops significantly during the recovery phase, it is overall slightly slower than front crawl, especially over longer distances.</p><p> Another reason it is slower is because of the extremely different physical exertion it puts on the swimmer compared to the freestyle. It's name was taken from the butterfly.The breaststroke, backstroke, and front crawl can all be swum easily even if the swimmer's technique is flawed.</P> <p>The butterfly, however, is unforgiving of mistakes in style; it is very difficult to overcome a poor butterfly technique with brute strength. Many swimmers and coaches consider it the most difficult swimming style. </p><p> The main difficulty for beginners is the synchronous over-water recovery, especially when combined with breathing, since both arms, the head, shoulders and part of the chest have to be lifted out of the water for these tasks. Once efficient technique has been developed, it becomes a smooth, fast stroke.</p><br><br><strong>Styles</strong>

<p>There are four styles of butterfly stroke.</p>
Two main styles of butterfly stroke seen today are: "arm pull up simultaneous with dolphin kick" and "arm pull down simultaneous with dolphin kick".

<p>"Arm pull up simultaneous with dolphin kick": After head goes underwater, both arms go underwater but still higher than head. After first dolphin kick, pull both arms immediately with downward motion. While pulling arms, legs are relaxed, both knees and waist are slightly bent to prepare dolphin kick.</p><p> After arms push water backward, pull arms up simultaneous with dolphin kick. In this style, turning point from drowning to floating is at the time of downward arm motion.</P>

<p>"Arm pull down simultaneous with dolphin kick": After head goes underwater, both arms go underwater until lower than head. After first dolphin kick, raise both arms with relax.</P><p> While rising arms, bend both knees and waist to send body back to the surface and prepare dolphin kick. Pull both arms downward while executing dolphin kick. After this sequence, immediately push the water backward.</p><p> In this style, turning point from drowning to floating is at the time of waist bend.

Two additional styles of butterfly stroke are similar to the two styles above, but without a "second" dolphin kick.[15] This allows the swimmer to conserve energy and be more relaxed.</p>
